# Gabor-transform-audio-analysis
This paper illustrates the advantages of Gabor transform and its modification to Fourier transform to 
perform time-frequency analysis. This technique allows us to extract feature from subsets of the original
data and understand better properties of each signalâ€™s part. This paper demonstrates the feature extraction 
on audio analysis application by using spectrograms and sound frequency retrieval from musical recordings.
